<h3>What is all this about?</h3>
<p>The first reason for this website is having a nice overview of conferences that are of interest to noncommutative algebraic geometers. There are the excellent <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~fdlist/">FDLIST</a>, <a href="http://commalg.org">commalg.org</a> and <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/conferences.html">Vakil's list</a> for conferences related to representation theory (respectively commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry), but not every event interesting for people working in noncommutative algebraic geometry is listed there.
<p>Besides listing events, the main example of what we will try to do is providing a noncommutative algebraic geometry analogue of <a href="http://www.commalg.org/">commalg.org</a>, which provides an excellent website for the commutative algebra community. We'll see how far we get in this respect.

<h3>What is noncommutative algebraic geometry?</h3>
<p>Ahh, that is a hairy question. Let's say that for the purposes of this website, noncommutative algebraic geometry means something like:
<ul>
  <li>studying algebraic geometry (and various types of rings and algebras) using triangulated categories and friends,
  <li>studying noncommutative objects using tools from algebraic geometry (e.g. moduli spaces), which in particular includes noncommutative analogues of algebraic geometry such as Artin&ndash;Zhang-style noncommutative projective geometry.
</ul>
Although very interesting subjects themselves, we will not necessarily try to keep you updated on things like C<sup>*</sup>-algebras or Connes-style noncommutative differential geometry. It turns out that there already is an initiative in this area: <a href="http://noncommutativegeometry.nl"><code>noncommutativegeometry.nl</code></a>, by <a href="http://www.waltervansuijlekom.nl/">Walter van Suijlekom</a>.
