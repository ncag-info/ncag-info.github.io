<p>It turns out that there is a website similar to this one, tailored towards less algebraic (and hence more analytic) flavours of noncommutative geometry. It can be found at <a href="http://noncommutativegeometry.nl"><code>noncommutativegeometry.nl</code></a>, and it has been around already for a few years now. It is maintained by <a href="http://www.waltervansuijlekom.nl">Walter van Suijlekom</a>.
<p>They feature a <a href="http://noncommutativegeometry.nl/blog">blog</a> containing conference announcements, and a list of <a href="http://www.noncommutativegeometry.nl/documents/">interesting background articles</a>. I have been thinking about compiling a similar list for noncommutative algebraic geometry, but that hasn't happened yet.
