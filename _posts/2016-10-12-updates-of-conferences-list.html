<p>If you are interested in keeping up-to-date with the conferences list and you wish to get a notification each time a conference is added, it turns out that GitHub provides an <a href="https://github.com/ncag-info/ncag-info.github.io/commits/master/_data/conferences.yml.atom">Atom feed</a> for the file where all conferences are collected. It suffices to add this link to your feed reader (if you still use such a thing).

<p><small>It turns out that they do not list this file as an Atom feed for the <code>conferences.yml</code> file on the <a href="https://github.com/ncag-info/ncag-info.github.io/commits/master/_data/conferences.yml">commits page of this file</a>. So maybe this functionality will break at some point.</small>

<p>The less tech-savvy people can also click on the <em>Last updated date</em> on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/conferences">conference list</a>, to go to the commits page of the relevant file, and figure out themselves which conferences are new. Please note that this date is not entirely correct, in the sense that it is not based on changes to the relevant file, but to all files.
