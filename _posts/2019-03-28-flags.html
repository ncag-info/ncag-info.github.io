<p>I've been regularly updating the conferences list, in case you were wondering whether this website sees any activity. Aside from that there is nothing new.
<p><em>Except</em> that I have now decorated all locations with a little flag. Because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology">vexillology</a> is fun!
