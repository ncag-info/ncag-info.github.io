I just moved everything over to GitHub Pages, and reconfigured the DNS so that instead of a redirect to a subdirectory on the department's server the website is fully functional on the actual domain. If this doesn't mean anything to you but you see <code>ncag.info</code> in your address bar, then everything is fine.
