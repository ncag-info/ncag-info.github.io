<h3>What is all this about?</h3>
<p>The first reason for this website is having a nice overview of conferences that are of interest to noncommutative algebraic geometers. There are the excellent <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~fdlist/">FDLIST</a>, <a href="http://commalg.org">commalg.org</a> and <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/conferences.html">Vakil's list</a> for conferences related to representation theory (respectively commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry), but not every event interesting for people working in noncommutative algebraic geometry is listed there.
<p>Besides listing events, the main example of what we will try to do is providing a noncommutative algebraic geometry analogue of <a href="http://www.commalg.org/">commalg.org</a>, which provides an excellent website for the commutative algebra community.

<h3>What is noncommutative algebraic geometry?</h3>
Ahh, that is a hairy question. For the purposes of this website, noncommutative algebraic geometry means either studying algebraic geometry using tools such various triangulated categories or studying noncommutative analogues of algebraic geometry such as Artin&ndash;Zhang-style noncommutative projective geometry. Although very interesting subjects themselves, we will not try to keep you updated on things like C<sup>*</sup>-algebras or Connes-style noncommutative differential geometry.
